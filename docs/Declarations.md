# Declare and define vars

## Using primitive type of data:
- string
- double
- int
- float
- bool

## Using initializator
int var{number}
- Other ways to initialize vars
- Use () for **constructor initialization**
- Use {} for **uniform initialization**

## Using auto and deduction
Converts a var into a other var that was initialized.
- **auto**: identify the type of var in the initialized var for be initialized.
- **decltype**: deduce the type of var in the initialized var even if was not initialized.
