# Recalling how to setup a cmake + C++ project

# 1. Create a CMakelists.txt
- Set Cmake version (required)
- Set basic project details (name, version, language)
- Set language config
- Set output directory (optional)
- Set sources dir and files (required for executable)

# 2. Create a CMakePresets.json
I've had to create it for compatibility with the compiler and
idk why was working before if was correct but, thats my setup.
- Set generator type (with visual studio C++ compiler obviously)
- Set binary dir for files generated by compiler
- Set cache vars like build type and toolchain file(vcpkg in this case).
> Note: Ninja config is not used.

# 3. Create project files
- src folder for... sources(cpp and h).
- build for generated by compiler files.
- bin for executable dir

# 4. Run in terminal
Just open CMD or terminal en vscode, go to exe dir and run.
